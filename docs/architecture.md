# Helix Architecture

## High-Level Overview
Helix is an AI-native command-line shell and adversarial cybersecurity platform written in Go. It bridges the gap between human intent and machine execution by combining local/remote LLM inference, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a multi-layer safety pipeline.

## Core Subsystems

### 1. Input Classification Engine (`internal/shell/classify.go`)
The entry point for all user input. It uses a weighted evidence system to classify input into:
- **Shell Command**: Bypasses the AI planner and executes directly through the safety pipeline.
- **Natural Language**: Routes to the AI Planner for intent resolution.
- **Slash Command**: Intercepts Helix-specific controls (`/help`, `/vuln`, `/audio`).

### 2. AI Planner & Agent Orchestrator (`internal/ai/planner.go`, `internal/agent/agent.go`)
- **Strict JSON Protocol**: The planner is forced to output a rigid JSON schema defining `intent` and `steps`.
- **Tool Use**: Supports `response`, `shell`, `git`, `package`, and `recon` tools.
- **Safety Layer**: Intercepts the plan to inject missing `git add` steps, normalize versions, and validate arguments before execution.

### 3. Shell Safety & Sandbox (`internal/commands/safety/`, `internal/commands/sandbox.go`)
A 4-stage defensive pipeline:
1. **Validation**: Unicode hazard detection, quote/brace balancing, and malicious pattern blocking.
2. **Risk Classification**: Categorizes commands into Low, Medium, and High risk.
3. **Sandbox Confinement**: Prevents write/delete operations outside the allowed directory tree.
4. **Execution**: Runs the command via the detected native shell.

### 4. RAG & Threat Intelligence (`internal/rag/`)
- **Vector Store**: TF-IDF and keyword-based search over 900+ indexed MAN pages.
- **Knowledge Base**: SQLite + FTS5 database hydrated with live feeds from NVD, CISA KEV, Exploit-DB, and MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Defensive Intel**: `/vuln` and `/explain` commands query this database to provide CVSS scores, patch guidance, and detection engineering context.

### 5. Terminal UX & Audio (`internal/shell/reader.go`, `internal/audio/`)
- **SYNAPSE Prompt**: TrueColor animated prompt with glitch effects, git telemetry, and transient history.
- **Synthetic Audio**: A `beep`/`oto` based synthesizer providing 350Hz data taps, 880Hz alerts, and 110Hz error buzzes synchronized with the typewriter effect.
